# Project 2: Crowdfunding ETL(Extract, Transform, and Load)

As a team, we created an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** using simulated data for the purpose of learning, which can translate to higher purpose use cases. 

## **Introduction**<br/>
As a team we had to: <br/>
* Utilize python/pandas to
  * Create a Category and Subcategory DataFrames <br/>
  * Create a Campaign DataFrame <br/>
  * Create a Contacts DataFrame <br/>
* Utilize postgres to
  * Create a Crowdfunding Database with a pairing ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) <br/>


## **How to Run**


## **Data**
For our analysis, we have transformed data extracted from the following datasets available in the Resources folder <br/>
   * contacts.xlsx <br/>
   * crowdfunding.xlsx <br/>


## **Outcome**
We were succesfully able to: <br/>
* export our DataFrames as csv files using *Starter_code.ipynb* <br/>
    * category.csv <br/>
    * subcategory.csv <br/>
    * campaign.csv <br/>
    * contacts.csv <br/>
* create a database schema with matching schema, ERD, and database using *crowdfunding_db_schema.sql* <br/>
    * (Name of ERD file) <br/>
    * crowdfunding_db_schema.sql <br/>


## **Technology/Tools used**
* Python <br/>
* Pandas <br/>
* Postgres <br/>
