# Project 2: Crowdfunding ETL(Extract, Transform, and Load)

As a team, we created an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using simulated data for the purpose of learning, which can translate to higher purpose use cases. 

## **Introduction**<br/>
As a team we had to: <br/>
*Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames <br/>
*Create the Campaign DataFrame <br/>
*Create the Contacts DataFrame <br/>
*Create the Crowdfunding Database with a pairing ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram) <br/>


## **Data**
For our analysis, we have utilized the following datasets available in the Resources folder.
contacts.xlsx
crowdfunding.xlsx


## **Outcome**
We were succesfully able to:
*export our DataFrames as csv files
    *category.csv
    *subcategory.csv
    *campaign.csv
    *contacts.csv
*create a database schema with matching schema, ERD, and database
    *(Name of ERD file)
    *crowdfunding_db_schema.sql


## **How-to-run guide:
Python <br/>
Pandas <br/>
Postgres <br/>
